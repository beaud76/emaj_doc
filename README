1- About E-Maj

E-Maj is a PostgreSQL extension.
The main goals of E-Maj are:
- log updates performed on one or several sets of tables.
- cancel these updates if needed, and reset a tables set to a predefined stable state.

E-Maj repository can be found on github (https://github.com/beaud76/emaj).


2- License

E-Maj and its documentation are distributed under the GNU General Public License.

The presentation offers a quick overview of the extension. It may be used to easily discover 
what is E-Maj. You may also use it as presentation support to present the extension to some 
other people.

The user's guide is the reference documentation that explains what is E-Maj, how to install 
it and how to use it.


4- How to improve the documentation

The source files are built with Libre Office softwares:
- the user's guides are produced by WRITER,
- the presentations are produced by IMPRESS.

Only a pdf version of these documents is supplied with each official E-Maj distribution.

Any improvement on these files is welcome and can be sent to the maintainer (see below).

If you wish to suggest improvements of the user's guide, be sure to record changes when 
using WRITER so that these changes can be easily located.


5- Online documentation

The detailed documentation is also available on line. The English version is at 
http://emaj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, while the French one is at 
http://emaj.readthedocs.io/fr/latest/. The source of this online documentation is part 
of the central E-Maj repository mentionned earlier. The online documentation content 
is supposed to be strictly equivalent to the .odt files.
